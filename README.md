### Building the Future with Blockchain, AI & Enterprise Technology

**Solution Architect • Tech Leader • Open Source Contributor**

## 🌟 What I Do

I **architect and build systems** that bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and real-world business needs. My passion lies at the intersection of:

🔗 **Decentralized Systems** — Creating trustless, transparent solutions using blockchain  
🤖 **Intelligent Automation** — Building AI agents that actually solve business problems  
🏢 **Enterprise Innovation** — Transforming legacy systems into modern, scalable platforms  

### Right Now I'm:

- 🛠️ Building **Web3 payment integrations** for enterprise e-commerce platforms
- 🧠 Experimenting with **AI agents** for business process automation
- 🔐 Exploring **decentralized identity** solutions and privacy-preserving tech
- 💡 Contributing to **open source** projects in the Algorand and Odoo ecosystems
- 📍 Based in **Munich, Germany** 🇩🇪

## 🎯 My Expertise

I work across the full technology stack, but I'm particularly passionate about these areas:

### 🔗 Blockchain & Decentralized Systems
Building the infrastructure for trustless systems. I've worked with everything from **Hyperledger** and **Solidity** to **Algorand**, with a special focus on **decentralized identity** (DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, Self-Sovereign Identity).

### 🤖 AI & Intelligent Systems  
Creating AI that adds real business value. From **MCP agents** to **workflow automation**, I build systems that think and adapt, not just follow scripts.

### ☁️ Cloud-Native Architecture
Designing scalable, resilient systems on **AWS** and **Azure**. Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform**, containerization with **Docker/Kubernetes**, and modern DevOps practices.

### 🏥 Healthcare Technology  
Deep expertise in healthcare standards (**HL7, FHIR, DICOM**) and medical system integration. I've built systems that handle millions of patient records while maintaining compliance and security.

## 🚀 Featured Work

### 💳 [AlgoBizSuite](https://github.com/SebaSco2/algobizsuite)
> **Making blockchain payments accessible for businesses**

Integrated **Algorand blockchain** into Odoo's e-commerce platform, enabling businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments (ALGO, USDC) with the same ease as traditional payment methods. This bridges the gap between enterprise ERP systems and Web3.

**The Challenge:** Most businesses want to accept crypto but find it too complex  
**The Solution:** Drop-in Pera Wallet integration for Odoo  
**Tech:** Python • Odoo • Algorand SDK • Web3  

---

### 🎭 Decentralized Identity Research
> **Your identity, under your control**

My Master's thesis explored how **Self-Sovereign Identity** could revolutionize healthcare records. Built a vaccine verification system using Hyperledger Indy and W3C Verifiable Credentials—technology that's now becoming the foundation of digital identity in the EU (eIDAS 2.0).

**The Vision:** Patients owning and controlling their medical data  
**The Tech:** Hyperledger Indy • Sovrin • W3C DIDs/VCs • Zero-Knowledge Proofs  
**The Impact:** Influencing EU digital identity standards  

---

### 🤖 AI Business Agents
> **Intelligent assistants that actually understand your business**

Created AI agents that integrate with enterprise systems to automate complex workflows. These aren't chatbots—they're intelligent workers that understand business context, make decisions, and execute tasks across multiple systems.

**The Problem:** ERP systems are powerful but complex  
**The Innovation:** AI agents that act as power-user assistants  
**Stack:** AWS Bedrock • MCP Protocol • Odoo • Python • LangChain  

---

### 🏥 Healthcare Interoperability
> **Making medical systems talk to each other**

Spent two decades building the plumbing that connects hospitals, labs, and medical devices. From Uruguay's first PACS system to multi-national healthcare platforms, I've helped millions of patients get better care through better technology.

**Impact:** Systems serving millions of patients across Latin America  
**Standards:** HL7 • FHIR • DICOM • IHE Profiles  
**Legacy:** Training the next generation through university collaborations

## 💪 Why I'm Different

**I speak three languages:** Business, Technology, and Human.

Most technologists can build impressive systems. What sets me apart is understanding **why** they need to exist and **how** people will actually use them. I've been a CTO, led teams, written code, and sat in board meetings. This unique perspective means I build solutions that:

- ✅ Actually solve real business problems (not just cool tech demos)
- ✅ Teams want to use (not just systems they're forced to adopt)
- ✅ Scale gracefully (learned from 25 years of battle scars)
- ✅ Balance innovation with pragmatism (blockchain where it makes sense, databases where they don't)

## 🎓 Credentials That Matter

🏆 **Master's in Blockchain** (UPC Barcelona) — Specialized in Decentralized Identity  
☁️ **AWS Certified** Solutions Architect & Developer  
🔐 **Hyperledger Aries Developer** — One of few with hands-on SSI experience  
🏗️ **HashiCorp Terraform Associate** — Infrastructure as Code expert  
🥈 **Hackathon Winner** — 2nd place Blockchain Mobility Challenge, Barcelona

---

## 🌍 Open Source & Community

I believe in giving back to the community that has given me so much:

- 🔧 **Contributing** to Odoo Community Association (OCA) projects
- 📚 **Mentoring** university students on healthcare tech projects  
- 🎤 **Speaking** at conferences about blockchain and healthcare standards
- 📖 **Teaching** — Developed DICOM courses for universities across Colombia
